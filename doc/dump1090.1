.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
Dump1090 receives Mode S (ADS-B) messages from RTL-SDR (Software Defined
Radio) USB dongles and optionally network sources and makes those messages
available in various formats as a server on various TCP ports.
.Pp
It also includes a mini-webserver that provides a moving map display of
nearby detected aircraft to web browsers on the LAN.
.Pp
.Nm
established an encrypted, compressed TLS connection with FligthAware and logs 
in using a FlightAware user name and password.
At the same time it tries to
connect to a program on the local computer providing ADS-B messages in 
"beast" binary format, typically \fBdump1090\fR.
.Pp
It then filters and coalesces those messages and forwards them over the
TLS connection where they contribute to the accuracy of FlightAware's
flight tracking.
.Pp
(People who forward ADS-B messages to FlightAware automatically qualify for
a free upgrade to an Enterprise Account.  For more information please visit
http://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/)
.Pp
On startup piaware attempts to connect to port 10001 to obtain the filtered,
coalesced ADS-B messages.  If the machine is running the FlightAware-modified
version of dump1090 (https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090_mr) then it
will obtain those messages directly.
.Pp
If the site is not running FA-modified dump1090 or is running a different
ADS-B provider program such as modesmixer then piaware will start a helper
program called faup1090 to translate between beast format and FlightAware
format.
.Pp
If installed from the Debian package, piaware will automatically start up at system boot time.
.Pp
Since other programs such as dump1090 may not have started yet, piaware will wait until something is there to provide ADS-B data.  Also piaware will automatically reconnect if that program stops and is started again and it will also periodically try to reconnect to FlightAware in the event that contact is lost.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -device-index Ar index
Select which RTL device to use if multiple are present.  The default is 0.
.It Fl -gain Ar db
Sets the gain of the RTL-SDR device.  The default is to set for max gain.  Use -10 for auto-gain.
.It Fl -enable-agc
Enable RTL-SDR automatic gain control.  AGC default state is off.
.It Fl -freq Ar hz
Sets the frequency sampled by the RTL-SDR device.  The default os 1090 MHz.
.It Fl -interactive
ENable interactive mode, periodically refreshing data on the terminal screen.
.It Fl -interactive-rows Ar num
Specifes the maximum number of rows presented in interactive mode.  The default is 15.
.It Fl -interactive-ttl Ar sec
Sets the number of seconds before aircraft are removed from the interactive display when no new messages have been received from that aircraft.  The default is 60 seconds.
.It Fl -interactive-rtl1090
Display the flight table in RTL1090 format.
.It Fl -raw
Show only messages' hex values.
.It Fl -net
Enable networking.
.It Fl -modeac
Enable decoding of SSR Mode-S 3/A and 3/C messages.
.It Fl -net-beast
Produce TCP raw output in Beast binary format
.It Fl -net-only
Enable just networking, don't even look for an RTL-SDR device.
.It Fl -no-rtlsdr-ok
Probe for an RTL-SDR device but keep going if one isn't found.  By default
dump1090 will exit if there is no RTL-SDR device found but this switch used
with the --net switch allows
.Nm
to start up as an ADS-B internetworked format translation service whether there is a local RTL device or not.
.It Fl -net-fatsv-port Ar port
Specify the FlightAware TSV-style output port.  The default is 10001.
.It Fl -net-ri-port Ar port
Specify the TCP raw input listening port.  The default is 30001.  This port can be connected to by data senders to push raw ADS-B messages to.
.It Fl -net-ro-port Ar port
Specify the raw output listening port.  The default is 30002.  Processes that connect to this port will receive messages received by dump1090 either from the radio source or a network source, in raw format.
.It Fl -net-sbs-port Ar port
Processes that connect to this port (default 30003) will receive ADS-B messages in Kinetic SBS format.
.It Fl -net-bi-port Ar port
Processes that connect to this port (default 30004) can send ADS-B messages to
.Nm
in Mode S Beast format.
.It Fl -net-bo-port Ar port
Processes that connect to this port (default 30005) will receive ADS-B messages from dump1090 in Mode S Besat format.
.It Fl -net-ro-size Ar size
Raw output minimum size.  Not sure.
.It Fl -net-ro-rate Ar rate
Raw memory flush rate.  Not sure.
.It Fl -net-heartbeat Ar rate
TCP heartbeat rate in seconds.  The default is 60 seconds.  Set to 0 to disable.
.It Fl -net-buffer Ar n
Specify the TCP buffer size as N where the amount is 64 KByte * 2^N.  The default is 0, 64 KBytes.
.It Fl -lat Ar latitude
Specify the receiver latitude.  If specified provides reference information for surface position messages.
.It Fl -lon Ar longitude
Specify the receiver longitude.  If specified provides reference information for surface position messages.
.It Fl -fix
Enable single-bit error correction using CRC.
.It Fl -no-fix
Disable single-bit error correction using CRC.
.It Fl -no-crc-check
Still process messages with broken CRC.  (strongly discouraged)
.It Fl -phase-enhance
Enable phase enhancement during RTL-SDR decoding.
.It Fl -aggressive
Aggressively attempt to use more CPU power to decode more messages.  Not recommended by Malcolm Robb and/or FlightAware if you are sharing due to its propensity to produce incorrect messages.
.It Fl -mlat
Not sure.
.It Fl -stats
With --ifile print stats at exit.  Produces no other output.  Only useful for testing and experimenting with dump1090 itself.
.It Fl -stats-every Ar seconds
Show and restat stats every this-many seconds.
.It Fl -onlyaddr
Show only ICAO addresses.  Useful only for testing purposes.
.It Fl -metric
Use metric units (meters, KM/h, etc) rather than standard aviation units.
.It Fl -snip Ar level
Strip IQ file, removing samples that are less than the value of the specified level.  Again only useful for testing dump1090.
.It Fl -debug Ar flags
Enable verbose debugging modes, see the README file for details.
.It Fl -quiet
Disable output to standard out.  Use for applications where dump1090 is run as a daemon.
.It Fl -ppm Ar error
Set the receiver error rate in parts per million.  The default is 0.
.It Fl -help
Emit a brief summary of
.Nm
usage options.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Run dump1090 from the command line in quiet mode, with network support,
with it being OK if there is no RTL-SDR dongle attached, and with some
network buffering and rate switches:
.Pp
.Dl $ dump1090 --quiet --no-rtlsdr-ok --net --net-ro-size 500 --net-ro-rate 5 --net-buffer 5
